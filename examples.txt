Hello there, welcome to our SWBIOT tutorial, let's start with fundenmetnals

our conventional data types are regular to the c++ and java except, we use uppercases in order to Differentiate 

1 - INT a; // created an integer named a,will return    TYPE IDENTIFIER SEMICOLON
2 - INT x = 102; // created an integer named b, and will return   TYPE IDENTIFIER = EXP SEMICOLON

These are the most simple examples. Let's get to our new examples

1 - SENSOR sensorTest;  // created a sensor named sensorTest which will return us       SENSOR IDENTIFIER SEMICOLON
2 - sensorTest << HUM(5);   // now we assinged the value of the sensorTest to an external sensor named HUM(5) which is the fifth humidity sensor in this case 
this expression will return us      IDENTIFIER << HUM LP integer literal RP SEMICOLON     // buraya bakin
// we can only assign the SENSOR variable via using operator "<<" in order to reduce complication 

The switch coponent is similiar in terms of used tokens.

1 - SW1 >> true; // now, since our hardware only got 10 switches, we predefined 10 switches in our language sucha as SW1 , SW2 ... SW10.
// with this expression we assigned our first switch to 1 or true.  Which will create the token     SWITCH >> BOOL SEMICOLON

1 - URL urlTest; // created an URL Variable which will return       URL IDENTIFIER SEMICOLON
2 - urlTest = 'example HTML code';   // we assigned our URL variable to an html using  ' . Our ' is reserved just for assigning HTMLs for our URL type 
// the second sentence will return us       IDENTIFIER = URLSTRING SEMICOLON
